# Trails-OrbCom
> Generate and search combinations of orbments for Trails in the sky SC

Good quartz combinations are the backbone of combat in the Trails in the Sky games. But the in-game UI is cluttered and hard to use, making it hard to see which combinations of quartz will give the best combination of arts. This script generates a comprehensive list of all possible combinations of quartz and resulting arts.

## Usage Guide

1. Download the files
2. In Quartz.csv, set the value of 'enabled' to True for all the quartz you want to include and False for the rest.
3. In OrbmentCombinatorics.py set the length of the line of quartz, the quartz you want to include and the quartz you want to exclude.
4. Run OrbmentCombinatorics.py
5. The script will produce the file Orbments.csv with all possible combinations available.
